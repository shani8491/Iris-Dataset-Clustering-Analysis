# Iris-Dataset-Clustering-Analysis
This project applies K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to the Iris Dataset from sklearn. The goal is to group iris flowers into clusters based on their features. Results are visualized through scatter plots, highlighting distinct patterns and insights.
**Iris Dataset: A Clustering Approach**  

This project explores clustering techniques using the famous **Iris Dataset** from the `sklearn` library. The dataset contains **150 samples** of iris flowers categorized into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**, with four key features â€” **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**.  

The objective of this project is to uncover natural groupings within the dataset without prior knowledge of the species labels, using unsupervised learning techniques like **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering**.  

### Key Steps in the Project:  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was cleaned, and unnecessary columns were removed to ensure smooth clustering.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations, including **boxplots** and **scatter plots**, were used to understand feature distributions and detect outliers.  
3. **Clustering Algorithms:**  
   - **K-Means Clustering:** The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Dendrograms were plotted to identify cluster linkages and structures.  
4. **Visualization:** Scatter plots were created for **petal and sepal dimensions**, showing clear separations between clusters.  
5. **Evaluation:** The clustering results were evaluated by comparing them with the actual species labels, and insights were drawn based on cluster overlaps and separations.  

This project highlights the effectiveness of clustering algorithms in identifying patterns in well-known datasets like Iris. It also demonstrates the importance of visualization and evaluation metrics in interpreting clustering results. The analysis serves as a foundation for understanding unsupervised learning concepts and can be a valuable reference for data science enthusiasts.
